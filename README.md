### Hi there 👋
 
Good morning. I am currently a student whose goal is to become a junior developer.
I am constantly working on the daily commit movement. 
Whenever I want to give up, I always shout "I make it myself" .
```
🌱 I’m currently learning-JavaScript ,Java, python
`````
````

````
```
- 💬 Ask me about -JS, Java questions are welcome
```
